# About

Hey there, my name is Payton Burdette and I’m a Frontend Engineer. I live and work in Anderson, South Carolina. I’m happily married to my wonderful wife Ashley, and I’m a father to our beautiful daughter Lynley. If I had to describe myself in one word, it would probably be driven. I like to get shit done.

I value a healthy work/life balance. I don’t enjoy being micromanaged, I like being treated as an adult where I’m trusted to get the job done. I’m a hard worker and enjoy what I get to do everyday.

When I graduated high school, I actually had my mind set on working with my hands. I thought I wanted to pursue something in the carpentry field. My family pushed me to pursue something with technology, since I was always the tech guru in our family. I took their advice and attended a local technical college to study computer science. While in college, I landed an internship for web development. The company ended up hiring me as a web developer where I spent a year building websites. I learned a lot and it really kick started my career.

I’m currently a frontend engineer at GitLab on the Verify team. In my free time, I enjoy playing golf, binge watching shows and spending time with my family. The last show I watched that was great was Bodyguard, I highly recommend giving it a watch.
